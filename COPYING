The code was written by Matthias Hoelzl (tc@gauss.muc.de) and is placed in the
public domain. Rainer Joswig added the package definition and MCL patches.

Thanks to Rainer Joswig for pointing out errors and sending me notes on the
design as well as MCL patches and to Douglas Thomas Crosher who found a bug in
the definition of the method qualifier patterns.

WARNING: This code is still in its very early stages and not suitable for
production use.

Have fun,
   Matthias
