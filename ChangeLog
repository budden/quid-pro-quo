 * Moved project to github. All new changes can be seen in the revision history.

1999-08-03  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
 * Removed the possibility to add a contract-specification-string
   to pre- and postconditions for acl5 compatibility.
 * Improved the output for pre- and postconditions without
   descriptions.

1998-10-14  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
 * Fixed the qualifiers to use dotted lists as required by the
   standard (thanks to Douglas Thomas Crosher for setting me
   straight on this).
 * Disabled the keyword arguments for PCL based implementations
   so that the code compiles on them.

1998-10-13  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
 * Contract checks can now be disabled for each generic function
   with the keyword arguments :precondition-check,
   :postcondition-check and :invariant-check to the
   :method-combination argument.  Unfortunately this breaks on
   PCL-based implementations.

1998-10-12  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
 * Defined error classes so that contract violations can be
   recognized and caught.
 * Changed method combination type to allow descriptions
   of the contract which are stored in the condition that
   is signalled when the contract is violated.
 * Changed defclass to allow :invariant functions to be
   preceeded by a descriptive string.
 * Features :dbc-precondition-checks, :dbc-postcondition-checks
   and :dbc-invariant-checks must be present for the checks to
   be enabled at compile time.
 * `define-slot-accessor-invariants' takes additional
   description argument.
 * `getf-and-remove' now returns the cdar of the found pair as
   first argument and not the cadar.

1998-10-11  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
 * Added default method for `check-invariant'.
 * Removed `(ensure-generic-function 'check-invariant)' from
   `define-check-invariant-method'.
 * Changed method combination type of `check-invariant' to
   standard method combination.

1998-10-11  Rainer Joswig
 * Added package definition.
 * Added MCL patches.

1998-10-07  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
 * Initial version.
 * Changed handling of pre-/postconditions and invariants to
   match Eiffel's behavior more closely.  Errors are now signalled
   by the method combination.
