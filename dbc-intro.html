    <h1>Design by Contract</h1>

    <h2>What is it all about?</h2>
    
    <p>
      One main goals of every program is reliability, that is,
      correctness and robustness.  A program is correct if it performs
      according to its specification, it is robust if it handles
      situatios that were not covered in the specification in a
      graceful manner.  One way to prove the correctness of a program
      with respect to a (formal) specification is the Hoare calculus.
      Based on this formal method Bertrand Meyer developed a method of
      software engeneering called Design by Contract.

    <p>
      The principal idea of Design by Contract (DBC) is that a class
      and its clients have a contract with each other: The client must
      guarantee certain conditions before calling a method specialized
      on the class (the preconditions), the class guarantees certain
      properties after the call (the postconditions).  If the pre- and
      postconditions are included in a form that the compiler can check,
      then any violation of the contract between caller and class can 
      be detected immedeately.

    <h2>Support for Design by Contract in Programming Languages</h2>

    <p>
      The language that offers the best support for DBC is <a
      href="http://www.eiffel.com">Eiffel</a>, designed by Bertrand
      Meyer.  It is rather difficult to add support for DBC to most
      other languages, but not so for Common Lisp: I have written a <a
      href="dbc.lisp">package for Common Lisp</a> that provides
      support for DBC.  It is still very new and not too well tested
      so you should expect some rough edges and changes in its future
      design.  There is no larger program depending on this package
      available, only <a href="dbc-test.lisp">some silly test
      cases</a>.  Since I intend to use the dbc package for my own
      programs this should change in the not so distant future.
